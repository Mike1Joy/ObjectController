Test 1: Object - Object
- Both objects identical (default stretcher)
- Left object starts closer to thin gap so it gets there first
- Right object moves out of its way even though they have the same drive

Test 2: Object - Person
- Object same as test 1
- Person is default (tried with lots of drives but got the same result)
- Person moves out of the way the instant the object enters the thin part. Person waits for object to pass, then enters the thin part

Screenshot Stages:
0. Initial state
1. Both entities move towards their goals (equal drive)
2. Device enters corridor, other entity moves to one side (device high drive)
3. Device travels down corridor, other entity waits (device high drive)
4. Device exits corridor, other entity begins to move towards goal (equal drive)
5. Device is clear of corridor, other entity enters corridor, device makes way for other entity (equal drive)
