Test 1: Object - Object
- Both objects identical (default stretcher)
- Left object starts closer to thin gap so it gets there first
- Right object moves out of its way even though they have the same drive

Test 2: Object - Person
- Object same as test 1
- Person is default (tried with lots of drives but got the same result)
- Person moves out of the way the instant the object enters the thin part. Person waits for object to pass, then enters the thin part
