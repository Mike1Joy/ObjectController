Test 1: Object - Object
- Both objects identical (default stretcher)
- Left object starts closer to thin gap so it gets there first
- Right object moves out of its way even though they have the same drive

Test 2: Object - Person
- Object same as test 1
- Person is default (tried with lots of drives but got the same result)
- Person does  not seem to move out of the way of the object the same as test 1. Instead the person enters the thin section while the object is still there, blovking its path.
- This is not the desired outcome. There may be an issue with the way the person is reacting to the PVO
