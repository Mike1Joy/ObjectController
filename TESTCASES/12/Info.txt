All objects were EC with different stair rules:

(EC was 0.35 from inside by default)
Object 1 - inside lane (0.45 from inside)
Object 2 - outside lane (0.45 from outside)
Object 3 - middle lane (0.7 from inside)


Geometry is based on Hunt2016 Figure 6-13 (* not based on Hunt):

Stair width = 1.4
Stair length = 3.6*
Stair height = 3*
Riser num = 15*
Lanes (nodes across) = 3*
Landing depth = 1.4
Landing width = 3.4 (it is 3.3 in Hunt2016, but 3.4 is much easier to make in OC)
