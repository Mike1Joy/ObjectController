Attachment time: 40s for PRM, 1s each for attendants

To make this work:
One attendant has OIL for pick up (next to object), collect person (on node PRM is on), drop off (at exit)
Other attendant just has OIL for pick up (next to object)
PRM has OIL to move away from the node they were on and delay for infinity, otherwise object gets stuck trying to move to same node

Observations:
Everything happened as expected
